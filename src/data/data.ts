        question: 'What is the event loop in JavaScript?',
        answer: 'The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations by continuously checking the message queue and executing callback functions when the call stack is empty.',

        question: 'What is hoisting in JavaScript?',

        question: 'What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?',
        answer: 'Synchronous code executes sequentially, blocking further execution until the current task is complete. Asynchronous code allows other tasks to run while waiting for an operation to complete.',
